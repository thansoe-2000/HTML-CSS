            <h1>A Snatch From the day-dreaming One</h1>
            <p>
                
                It was an event in which I was living in a top flat of a
 six-storey building dowmtwon. I was looking outside through the window 
panes as usual. I leisurely looked at the outer scene that I had known 
as a bird-eye view.On my table, there was a cup of hot plain tea which 
was mixed with green tea leaves from Aung pan. I was somewhat satisfied 
with the situation of the early morning sipping the plain tea and 
looking outside through the window panes.

                About a week ago, an earthquake hit our city. Our 
six-storey building was obviously shaken to and fro. It happened twice 
and then it was again normal and stable. Although, I had a little 
frightened feeling. I went on staying calm bearing in mind that only 
fate is my dad or my mom. The scene, I was seeing was some roofs of the 
buildings, the upper parts of some lamp-posts which were on at night and
 a mountain range.
                The place where I live is in the center of the town. I 
can vividely hear the traffic and the voice of the vendors who are 
selling their goods around the city. I sometimes hear the pleasing 
melodic songs from the small vehicles which sell lottery. I also hear 
the reciting of Paritta and sharing merit from the common hall for 
religious purposes nearby. I also hear the faint sound of the reading 
Bible from the Chruch which is situated somewhat distant on Sundays.

                Looking between the two window panes. I see the two 
crows flying and coming towards the building. They are not rural crows 
but urban ones. They posses things such as wings to fly where they want 
and beaks to bite and lift up what they want, which are similar to be 
regulated by nature. It is a sunny day and all are clear and bright. 
There is the blue sky but some blackish rain clouds are scattered at the
 edge of the horizon.
                I have seen a female beef seller getting to the room on 
the ground floor. I have also seen a clerk who reads the used units from
 the electric-meters. I have also seen a young but well-known writer 
getting to the room next to mine. The cup of hot plain tea seems to be 
in a certain state to drink. I think, but it is still warm.
                Last night, I read a short story written by O Henry 
before I went to sleep. The story was "The last leaf" that was written 
about two young female artists and an old man who was also an artist. I 
like short stories especially the ones by O Henry. The plots of the 
short stories constructed by O Henry are very interesting indeed. The 
readers never know the end of the story unless the read it up to the 
end. I think he was a clever writter who could totally occupy the 
interest of the readers. I also think if I read and understand O Henry's
 structures of stories a lot. I can be able to guess the twists of human
 society.
